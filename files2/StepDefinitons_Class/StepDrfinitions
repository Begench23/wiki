    STEP_DEFINITION:

        It is a package where feature file contents are expanding,
        Where the Automation Testing is done.

        It is where "steps" are transforming to snippets/ methods.
                (each step is one method, or one snippet)

        It is where the glue= content to running, for CukesRunner Class.

        It is the package where the ".java" files for Testing is Stored,
        The name of a Classes doesn't matters, Cos Cucumber Run it by the
        feature files name, and Step orders in Scenario,
        But it is Better to give name for Step_Definition Class the name of the
        feature file That steps are defined.
            And the order of methods doesn't matter. It will run by steps order in
            feature files.


     EX1:    @When("user enters student username")
                 public void userEntersStudentUsername(){
                       // some codding
                 }

     EX2:    @When("user type {string} in the wiki search box")
                public void user_type_in_the_wiki_search_box(String string) {
                    elements.searchBox.sendKeys(string);
                }

        It will run by @Annotations in the top of Method Signature.
        Annotations "text" btw double coats have to match exactly same with
        feature step (Given, When, Then)

        1. @Given can come from different Step_Definition Class, cos it is pre-Condition
        2. @When needs to make a given action in WebPage (logic/implementation)
        3. @Then where we do assertion for expected and actual (best if visible)
