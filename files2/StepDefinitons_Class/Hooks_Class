     HOOKS:

            If repeating steps for Test. No need to add it every time,
            it's going to make a step duplication, use Hooks in thous situations


   Global Hooks:        Feature Level / Before-AfterClass(Feature)
   Hooks:               Scenario Level / Before-After each Scenario/s
   Step Hooks           Step Level / Before-After each Step/s


         @BeforeAll

            (FEATURE start)

                @Before

                    (SCENARIO start)

                        @BeforeStep

                            (STEP Start- @When/@And/@Given/@Then)
                            (STEP End)

                        @AfterStep

                    (SCENARIO end)

                @After

            (FEATURE end)

         @AfterAll


    ------------------------------


        1. Step Before After

            if @BeforeStep executes, than @AfterStep will also
            if step fails..next steps will skipped, and so @BeforeStep and @AfterStep too
            for that given next steps
            But not @Before And @After cos they belong to Scenario, step won't effect the


        2. Conditional Hooks:  add tags for Hooks Annotation to run only with given tag etc.


        1. @BeforeAll: if you setUp driver before your Features start testing
        2. @Before : if you have a situation where you need to Login before every Scenario

        3. @After : if you logout after your Scenario and if Scenario fails take screenshot
        4. @AfterAll: if you closing/quit your driver After you test Feature.
