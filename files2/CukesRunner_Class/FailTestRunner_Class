    FAILED TESTS:

    Creat new Class for only for Failed Scenarios to run.
        in Runner package


        1. This class is going to be runnable with JUnit/Cucumber as well like
            normal Runner Class
        @RunWith(Cucumber.com)

        2. Running criteria is achieved by Cucumber Options too

            Where it need 2 information: feature and glue

          EX1:
                 @CucumberOptions(
                         features ="@target/failReport.txt" ,
                         glue = "com/cydeo/step_definitions"
                 )

             1. Features: Which features should be run,
                    (if we add features files from resources it will run everything,
                    that's why we give and path what to run for rerun report path,
                    where is only failed Scenarios)

                    @ -> is a syntax
                    target/failReport.txt -> is a file path where the features to be run

             2. Glue : is from where Runner Class going to get StepDefinition Classes where
                        scrips are stored. With methods and @Annotations that runnable
