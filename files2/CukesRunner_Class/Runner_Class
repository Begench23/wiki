    Runner Class:

        is used to run all automation from one place.



    1.     It is a class and it makes run everything threw:
             @RunWith (Cucumber.class)




    2.     And for Run in specific conditions/options it uses:
            @CucumberOptions(
                    ...,
                    ...,
                    ...
            )


-------------------------------------------------------------------

        CucumberOptions:


    1. features = "src/test/resources/features",

        This adds where Cucumber gets RUN ORDER from:
            *** path should start from source

    2. glue = "com/cydeo/step_definitions",

        This is a glue where Cucumber RUNS METHODS from:
            StepDefinition Class
            *** path should start from root

    3. dryRun = false/true,

        This is run all/only:

            1. dryRun = false,
                going to run both features and glue. (Scenarios)and(stepDefs)

            2. dryRun = true,
                going to run only features. No glue. methods() not going to
                execute, this maybe used to get Snippets to make StepDefs Class
                get ready.  (Try for generating snippets 3 way)

    4. tags = "@wip"/ "@smoke" / "@regression"

        This tag will give a condition to which Scenario
        or Feature itself to run:

            1. or: "@a or @b" : anything that contains one or another ||
                                    ex1:(@a, @b, @a @b)

            2. and: "@a and @b": only if both tags contains &&
                                    ex1: (@a @b) only

            3. and not: "@a and not @b": if @a presents and @b not
                                    ex1: (@a, @a @c)

            4. not: "not @a" : anything but @a
                                    ex1: (@b, @c)


    5. plugin = "html:target/cucumberReport.html",

        This is html: plugIn to get the Report from Cucumber;

        html:  is a plugin

        1. It needs a location where to STORE the report file,
        2. It needs NAME for a report file,
        3. It needs FORMAT of report file,
